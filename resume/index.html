<h1>Gabriella Files</h1>
<h2>Graphic Designer Student at Seminole State College</h2>
	<p>Gabriella Files is a <strong>hard working, determined designer</strong> who is currently studying at SSC. They have always strived to go above and beyond what is expected of them, trying to push any limit they can find. Gabriella, who normally goes by “Gabby,” has always had a passion for clean design work but is not afraid to get dirty with abstract pieces. After high school and before college, they went right into the work force, building a strong customer service background for 6 years. This amount of customer service experience gave them the appreciation for all walks of life and respect to others that they wish to see in the world. <br>Gabby can be found primarily on Instagram <strong>(@gabbyshibaki)</strong> but their work is spread around the internet with social medias like Reddit <strong>(@gabbyshibaki)</strong> and even some web design on GitHub.</p>
